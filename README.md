# Predictive Harvesting - Machine Learning for Crop Yield Prediction

## Overview
Predictive Harvesting is an advanced machine learning-based application that forecasts crop yields based on environmental factors, historical data, and soil characteristics. The project leverages AI-driven models to optimize resource allocation, reduce risks, and support sustainable agricultural practices.

## Features
- **Accurate Crop Yield Prediction** using Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.
- **Data Integration** from multiple sources, including weather conditions, soil properties, and crop history.
- **Resource Optimization** to enhance water, fertilizer, and labor usage efficiency.
- **Risk Mitigation** by anticipating weather conditions and pest outbreaks.
- **Scalability** for small-scale farms and large agricultural enterprises.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL (for future integration)
- **Development:** Python (Jupyter Notebook/VS Code)

## Project Structure
- **Research Papers & Documentation** (`BT-17 Research Paper.pdf`, `BT-17 Final Documentation.pdf`)
- **Presentation Slides** (`BT-17 AD Review Final.pptx`)
- **Codebase** (`Predictive Harvesting.ipynb`)
- **Dataset** (`crop_production.csv`)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt` if applicable).
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Train models using the provided Jupyter Notebook.
4. Evaluate predictions and optimize models.

## Future Enhancements
